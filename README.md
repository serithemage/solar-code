This repository contains Solar Code, a command-line AI workflow tool powered by **Upstage Solar Pro2** that connects to your tools, understands your code and accelerates your workflows.

Solar Code is based on the excellent Gemini CLI architecture, enhanced to work with Upstage's Solar Pro2 model for Korean developers and organizations.

With Solar Code you can:

- Query and edit large codebases with Solar Pro2's advanced language understanding.
- Generate new applications and code with Korean-optimized AI assistance.
- Automate operational tasks like querying pull requests and handling complex rebases.
- Integrate with development workflows using Solar Pro2's powerful code analysis capabilities.
- Use tools and MCP servers to connect new capabilities and extend functionality.
- Leverage Solar Pro2's multilingual support for Korean and English development contexts.

## Quickstart

Solar Code can be installed from source or as a packaged distribution.

### With Node (Development)

1. **Prerequisites:** Ensure you have [Node.js version 20](https://nodejs.org/en/download) or higher installed.
2. **Clone and install:** Execute the following commands in your terminal:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/solar-code/solar-code
   cd solar-code
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Run the CLI:**

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or use the development script:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/start.js
   ```

### Distribution Package (Coming Soon)

Solar Code distribution packages will be available soon for easier installation.

### Authentication Setup

1. **Get Solar Pro2 API Key:** Obtain your API key from [Upstage Console](https://console.upstage.ai/).
2. **Set Environment Variable:** Configure your Solar Pro2 API key:

   ```bash
   export SOLAR_API_KEY="your_solar_pro2_api_key_here"
   ```

3. **Optional Configuration:** Set additional environment variables if needed:

   ```bash
   export SOLAR_MODEL="solar-pro2"
   export SOLAR_BASE_URL="https://api.upstage.ai/v1"
   ```

4. **Pick a Color Theme:** Choose from available themes including the new Solar themes.

You are now ready to use Solar Code!

### Solar Pro2 API Configuration

Solar Code uses Upstage's Solar Pro2 API for AI-powered code assistance:

1. **Create an Upstage Account:** Sign up at [Upstage Console](https://console.upstage.ai/)
2. **Generate API Key:** Create a new API key in your Upstage dashboard
3. **Set Environment Variables:** Configure your API credentials:

   ```bash
   export SOLAR_API_KEY="your_solar_pro2_api_key"
   export SOLAR_MODEL="solar-pro2"  # Optional: default model
   export SOLAR_BASE_URL="https://api.upstage.ai/v1"  # Optional: custom endpoint
   ```

4. **Verify Configuration:** Test your setup by running Solar Code

For troubleshooting and advanced configuration, see the [authentication guide](./docs/cli/authentication.md).

## Examples

Once Solar Code is running, you can start interacting with Solar Pro2 from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
npm start  # or your Solar Code launcher
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project
cd your-project
npm start  # Launch Solar Code
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```

You can also ask in Korean:

```sh
> Ïù¥ ÏΩîÎìúÎ≤†Ïù¥Ïä§Ïùò Ï£ºÏöî ÏïÑÌÇ§ÌÖçÏ≤òÎ•º ÏÑ§Î™ÖÌï¥Ï£ºÏÑ∏Ïöî
