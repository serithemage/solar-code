git clone https://github.com/serithemage/solar-code.git
cd solar-code

# Install globally
make install

# Verify installation
solar --version
```

### Development Installation
```bash
# Clone and setup for development
git clone https://github.com/serithemage/solar-code.git
cd solar-code

# Setup development environment
make dev

# Install with symlink for development
make install-dev
```

### Manual Installation
```bash
# Install dependencies and build
npm ci
npm run build
npm run bundle

# Install globally
npm install -g .
```

## üîß Configuration

Set your Upstage API key:

```bash

export UPSTAGE_API_KEY="your_api_key_here"

# Option 2: .env file
echo "UPSTAGE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env
```

## ‚ú® Features

With Solar Code you can:

- Query and edit large codebases with Solar Pro2's advanced language understanding.
- Generate new applications and code with Korean-optimized AI assistance.
- Automate operational tasks like querying pull requests and handling complex rebases.

## üìñ Examples

Once Solar Code is running, you can start interacting with Solar Pro2 from your shell.

You can start a project from a new directory:

```sh
cd new-project/
solar
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

Or work with an existing project:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-org/your-project
cd your-project
solar
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```

You can also ask in Korean:

```sh
> Ïù¥ ÏΩîÎìúÎ≤†Ïù¥Ïä§Ïùò Ï£ºÏöî ÏïÑÌÇ§ÌÖçÏ≤òÎ•º ÏÑ§Î™ÖÌï¥Ï£ºÏÑ∏Ïöî
