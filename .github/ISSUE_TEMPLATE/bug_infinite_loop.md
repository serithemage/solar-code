## 🚨 Bug Description

Solar CLI enters an infinite loop when processing simple prompts, repeatedly generating "Please continue...." messages and making continuous API calls to the Solar API. This causes:

- Excessive API token consumption
- Poor user experience
- Resource waste
- Potential billing issues

## 🔍 Evidence from Debug Log Analysis

**Log File**: `solar-debug-20250816-230754.log`

### Key Patterns Identified:

1. **Initial Prompt**: User enters "테스트" (test)
2. **Loop Pattern**: After initial response, CLI automatically generates "Please continue...." messages
3. **API Call Frequency**: Every 2-3 seconds consistently
4. **Duration**: Loop continues indefinitely (logs show 6+ minutes of continuous calls)

### Sample Log Pattern:

```
🌊 Solar API Streaming Request: {
  url: 'https://api.upstage.ai/v1/solar/chat/completions',
  model: 'solar-pro2',
  messagesCount: 3,
  maxTokens: 4096,
  temperature: 0,
  stream: 'enabled',
  timestamp: '2025-08-16T14:07:58.117Z',
  lastUserMessage: 'Please continue....'
}
```

### Statistics from Log:

- **Total API Calls**: 100+ streaming requests + 20+ regular requests
- **Time Span**: ~6 minutes (14:07:56 - 14:13:53)
- **Call Interval**: 2-3 seconds between each call
- **Token Usage**: Significant (400+ prompt tokens per call)

## 🎯 Expected Behavior

1. Process initial user prompt ("테스트")
2. Generate appropriate response
3. **Stop** and wait for next user input
4. No automatic "Please continue" generation

## 🐛 Actual Behavior

1. Process initial user prompt ("테스트")
2. Generate response
3. **Automatically** append "Please continue...." to conversation
4. **Continuously** make API calls with this auto-generated message
5. Loop continues indefinitely

## 🔧 Technical Analysis

### Suspected Root Causes:

1. **Streaming Response Handler**: May not properly detect completion
2. **Conversation State Management**: Auto-continuation logic triggering incorrectly
3. **Response Parsing**: Incomplete response detection leading to continuation
4. **Temperature Setting**: `temperature: 0` may contribute to repetitive behavior

### Code Areas to Investigate:

- Streaming API response handling in `solarContentGenerator.ts`
- Conversation flow control logic
- Response completion detection
- Auto-continuation conditions

## 🧪 Reproduction Steps

1. Run Solar CLI with debug logging enabled:
   ```bash
   DEBUG=true npx solar --debug --prompt "테스트"
   ```
2. Observe continuous API calls in debug output
3. Log will show repeating "Please continue...." messages

## 📊 Impact Assessment

**Severity**: High

- **User Experience**: Poor (infinite loop)
- **Cost Impact**: High (excessive API usage)
- **Resource Usage**: High (continuous CPU/network)
- **Trust Impact**: High (users may lose confidence)

## 🔍 Suggested Investigation Plan

1. **Debug Stream Handling**: Add detailed logging to streaming response processing
2. **Conversation State**: Review auto-continuation conditions
3. **Response Parsing**: Verify completion detection logic
4. **Add Guards**: Implement maximum continuation limits
5. **User Control**: Ensure user can interrupt/stop the loop

## 💡 Potential Solutions

1. **Immediate Fix**: Add continuation limit (max 3 auto-continues)
2. **Medium Term**: Improve completion detection logic
3. **Long Term**: Review entire conversation flow architecture

## 🏷️ Labels

- `bug` - Software defect
- `high-priority` - Affects core functionality
- `infinite-loop` - Specific pattern type
- `api-usage` - Related to API consumption
- `user-experience` - Impacts user interaction

## 📝 Additional Context

This issue significantly impacts the usability of Solar CLI and can lead to unexpected API costs for users. The infinite loop pattern suggests a fundamental issue with conversation state management that needs immediate attention.
